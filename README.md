# Project Description: 5-DOF Robotic Manipulator with Motion Training and Playback

The 5-DOF Robotic Manipulator project presents a robotic arm system that can be trained to perform specific motions and subsequently reproduce those motions accurately. The manipulator is composed of aluminum links, and servo motors serve as actuators to drive the arm's movements. By storing the motor angles in the EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) of the controller, the trained movements persist even when the power is turned off.

## Key Features

1. Five Degrees of Freedom: The robotic manipulator consists of five joints, allowing for a wide range of movements and positioning capabilities. Each joint is actuated by a servo motor, providing precise control over the arm's motion.

2. Motion Training: The system allows users to train the robotic arm to perform specific movements or sequences. By manually manipulating the arm, the angles of the servo motors are recorded and stored in the controller's EEPROM. This process enables the robot to learn and replicate complex motions accurately.

3. Motion Playback: Once a motion is trained, the robot can execute the recorded movement repeatedly. By accessing the angles stored in the EEPROM, the robotic manipulator precisely replicates the trained motion, enabling consistent and repeatable actions.

4. EEPROM Persistence: The trained motions remain stored in the EEPROM, ensuring that the recorded movements are retained even if the power supply is disconnected or the system is restarted. This feature eliminates the need to retrain the robot after power cycles.

5. Aluminum Link Construction: The robotic arm is constructed using aluminum links, providing durability, strength, and stability to the overall structure. The aluminum material ensures reliable and precise movements while keeping the weight of the arm manageable.

The 5-DOF Robotic Manipulator with Motion Training and Playback project offers a versatile and adaptable solution for automation tasks requiring specific arm movements. Its ability to record and reproduce trained motions provides a valuable tool for repetitive tasks in various applications, such as manufacturing, assembly, and research. The project's focus on using servo motors and EEPROM storage enhances accuracy, reliability, and persistence of the trained movements, making it an effective robotic solution for motion-controlled operations.
